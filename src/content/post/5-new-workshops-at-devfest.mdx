### Best Practices for Testing in Postman

*Ruby Romeu*
Solutions Architect @ Postman and Organizer for Oviedo Codes

In this session, learners will see how various kinds of testing are possible within the Postman API development platform. We’ll define and design Functional, Performance, and End-to-End testing for a live API that we can fork and interact with in our own Postman workspaces. We’ll also check out how Postman’s new AI API companion, Postbot, can help us debug and script tests.

Ruby Roméu is a Solutions Architect at Postman and a local in Central Florida. She organizes Oviedo Codes and previously organized Rhode Island Codes. She’s a former kindergarten teacher and sports coach. She’s given talks at universities and tech conferences both virtually and in-person around the world and was named one of 100 Women in Tech to Follow and Learn From by Agile Testing Days.

### Workshop: Developing a Multimodal Chat that can generate images using Gemini and Imagen
*Henry Ruiz*
Research Scientist at Texas A&M AgriLife Research, GDE in ML

This workshop will explore the exciting intersection of multimodal AI and image generation, focusing on two powerful models: Google's Gemini and Imagen. Participants will learn how to leverage these cutting-edge technologies to create a chat interface capable of understanding and generating text and images. By the end of the session, attendees will have hands-on experience integrating these models into a functional multimodal chat application.

Meet Henry:
I'm a Research Scientist at Texas A&M AgriLife. My expertise and research interests lie in applying Geophysics tools like Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR), mathematical and electromagnetism simulations, signal processing, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. My current research is focused on designing, developing, and implementing end-to-end software solutions and computational algorithms to analyze remote sensing datasets to tackle agricultural challenges ( using state-of-the-art data science, signal processing, and machine learning methods).
Beyond my job, I am an open-source advocate deeply committed to community engagement and knowledge sharing. Leveraging on Google's recognition as a "Google Developer Expert" in Machine Learning and a "Google Cloud Champion," I do my best to actively contribute to the community by creating and publishing content around Machine Learning, TensorFlow, and related Google Cloud Platform(GCP) services, such as Vertex AI, speaking at developer conferences and meetups, and mentoring students and startups seeking guidance in the space of Machine Learning
