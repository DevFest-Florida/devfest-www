Let's face it: API design, app architecture and data handling do not make customers flock to your mobile app on their own.  But they are essential to every non-trivial app out there and the difference maker for creating efficient, robust apps that are easier to maintain and extend.

In this session, we'll cover the benefits of:

* Designing your API to deliver data just-in-time due to the constraints of mobile and knowing when and how to break that rule
* Returning an extensible error object with detailed information instead of re-throwing exceptions, returning error codes without context, or redeploying your app
* Compartmentalizing all REST calls into testable API clients
* Pre-processing data and caching in your app core along with network fault-tolerance
* Centralizing calls to logging, reporting, and analytics services
* Moving all data decisions as far into your app back-end as possible

Design Interactive, Software Engineer II & GDG Organizer

Join me for a fun and insightful session where we'll dive into the creation of "AI Quotes," a simple yet powerful mobile app built using Flutter and Firebase. In this session, I'll take you through the journey of developing this app for the Google I/O Extended Hackathon, highlighting key features and the technology stack that made it possible.

We'll explore how to leverage Firebase Functions for AI-powered quote generation, discuss the basics of using Cloud Firestore as a database, and emphasize the importance of securing your API keys, especially when working with sensitive services like the Gemini AI API.
