## 💡 Why You Should Join a Hackathon

#### [By Javi, Software Engineer & GDG Community Organizer](https://gdg.community.dev/u/javier4/#/about)

> 💬 "Talk is cheap. Show me the code." — Linus Torvalds

Hackathons are more than competitions — they're opportunities to **learn, collaborate, and grow**.
For anyone looking to break into tech or transition their career, **DevFest GemJam** is the perfect place to start your journey.

When you join a hackathon, you're not just building a project — you're building **connections**, gaining **hands-on experience**, and surrounding yourself with people who share your passion for solving problems.
You might even find yourself working alongside a **future co-worker or mentor** — someone who could recommend you for your next big opportunity.

## 🚀 Learning and Skill Development

A hackathon accelerates your growth faster than any tutorial ever could.

- **Hands-on experience:** Work directly with new frameworks, APIs, and tools.
- **Problem-solving:** Learn to deliver under pressure with limited time and resources.
- **Professional growth:** Identify your strengths and discover areas to improve.

Hackathons challenge you to think beyond "how to build something" and focus on **why it matters**.

## 🤝 Collaboration and Networking

At **GemJam**, collaboration is at the heart of everything we do.

- **Teamwork:** Build something meaningful with others who share your drive.
- **Community:** Connect with mentors, organizers, and developers from across Florida.
- **Professional connections:** Many participants find internships, job offers, or future co-founders from events like this.

> 💬 You never know — the person sitting next to you might be your next teammate or business partner.

## 🧠 Project Building and Innovation

Hackathons spark innovation like no other environment.

- **Build a project:** Turn your ideas into a working prototype or MVP.
- **Focus on creativity:** Experiment with AI, mobile, or web tech in new ways.
- **Present your work:** Pitch your project to judges and showcase your story.

It's not about perfection — it's about **progress** and the passion you bring to the table.
