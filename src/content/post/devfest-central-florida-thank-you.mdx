ü´∂ To all our industrious volunteers, we appreciate all your efforts to promote a welcoming spirit and make the event happen.  When you're serving a 200-person tribe, there's a lot of setup, planning, tear down, staging, creativity and customer service.  Thank you for your care and effort!  Your support and involvement have made a significant impact on our event, and we are truly grateful for the role each of you played in making DevFest Florida 2024 a success.

A special thank you to Gil‚Äôs wife and son and Michael‚Äôs son and daughter for stepping up and volunteering to support DevFest Florida. Your dedication and hard work behind the scenes did not go unnoticed. You are the rock and motivation that keeps us going, and we are truly grateful for your role in making this event a success. Your family support means the world to us!

üßë‚Äçüè´ I want to give a special "shout out" to Professor Marwan Shaban and the team from Seminole State College.  We appreciate you working closely with our Devfest execution team to make sure we had a great and comfortable learning environment for our guests, sponsors, and speakers.    I feel that Seminole State College is  providing vital leadership in growing the Central Florida ecosystem by supporting Florida technical communities.
Look out for more awesome tech events at Seminole State College including the following:

* **Orlando's 17th Annual SQL Saturday** is a FREE one-day training event for IT professionals and students interested in data platforms on Oct 12th.  Learn more at [SQLSaturday.com](https://sqlsaturday.com/2024-10-12-sqlsaturday1089/).  The schedule and speakers line up looks awesome!
* **Orlando Code Camp 2025** - Details coming.  We love collaboration with the .NET users group of Orlando. ([ONETUG](https://onetug.net/))

Finally, I wanted to offer my sincere thanks to our leadership team for DevFest Florida.  We can celebrate that we're growing one of the largest DevFests in the south.  I appreciate the team keeping our "true north" with helping our tribe learn and grow together.   We admire your passion for growing people and fostering our ecosystem of learning across meetup and technology boundaries.   Your commitment and persistence are truly inspiring.   Thank you, team!
