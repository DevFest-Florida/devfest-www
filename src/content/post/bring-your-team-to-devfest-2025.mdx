**For Early-Stage Developers:** This is your chance to go beyond theory. Our workshops and sessions are packed with hands-on, practical knowledge that you can apply immediately. You'll learn directly from industry leaders, covering everything from foundational skills to the latest trends in development.

You’ll hear from companies like Disney, Envy Labs, Google, Eccentex, Design Interactive and more.  We have some exciting partnerships to announce in the next week.

The keynote for GemJam is titled "We All Need Junior Developers."  Our friend Nick Walsh of Envy Labs and ODevs will address the challenges that entry-level developers face in a tough job market and argues that both organizations and senior developers need to actively support them.  Early-stage developers are the future of the industry.  GemJam offers a valuable opportunity for companies to meet and recruit promising new talent.
