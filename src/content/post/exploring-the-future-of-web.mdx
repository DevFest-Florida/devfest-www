State Management with Angular Signals is a cutting-edge topic that delves into the innovative features of Angular's latest updates. This talk will explore the introduction of Signals in Angular, a new reactive primitive that offers a more granular approach to tracking and updating application state. The discussion would cover the evolution from traditional BehaviorSubjects to Signals, highlighting the benefits of reduced boilerplate, improved performance, and a more intuitive API for developers. Attendees will learn how to implement Signals to manage state efficiently, with practical examples demonstrating the setup of a Signals-based service to store and update state across multiple components. The talk will also look at 3rd party options, such as NGRX Signal-Store. By the end of the session, developers will have a comprehensive understanding of Angular Signals and how to leverage them for more efficient and maintainable state management in their Angular applications.

**About Javiera Laso**: I am a biotech engineer who transition from the lab to the world of software. During my university years, I excelled in both fields becoming a teaching assistant in the IT engineering program while also pursuing my love for biotechnology. Post-graduation, I realized that working in lab environments with outdated software was limiting my potential to apply cutting-edge technology in biotech. So, I decided to take on a challenging journey to become a developer and bridge this gap. As a proud woman in tech my background enriches the landscape of software development. I am also an enthusiastic supporter of DDD as it can help us to bind the code with the business.

Developer Advocate @ CodingCat.dev

Whether directly or “under the hood”, most web developers are interacting with JSON web tokens (JWTs) to implement user authentication, handle sessions, and determine resource access. But why do we use them? What is their structure and how do they work? And what are the underlying technologies involved?
