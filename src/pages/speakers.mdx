This talk will explore the critical and often misunderstood role of the technical product manager in bridging the gap between research & development and real-world application. We will follow a model's lifecycle, from the initial stages of defining research goals, through the challenges of deployment, and into the long-term work of sustainment. Learn how effective technical product management ensures that groundbreaking research delivers tangible, valuable, and sustainable products.

### [Dwane Hemmings](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwane-hemmings/) | The Challenge: Building Community Through Live Streaming
Vonage

#### Hackathon Challenge
“The Challenge: Building Community Through Live Streaming.” Teams use the Vonage Video API (and optionally Messaging, Voice, etc.) to create an interactive live-streaming experience that goes beyond broadcasting — think Q&A, co-streaming panels, watch parties, captions, breakout rooms, etc. Goal: design an engaging solution that shows how live streaming can foster real community.

Dwane will be leading guests through an interactive code-along where participants:
- Get guided through Vonage’s APIs, sandbox, and dashboard
- Learn what Web Components are and who uses them
- Create a Web Component
- Use that Web Component in a framework of their choice
- Build a live streaming platform with the Vonage Video API

Team Vonage will be providing a Slack channel for participants to ask Vonage team for help.

### <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/delgueta">David M. Elgueta</a> | AI Agents, MCP, Langflow examples
Senior Technical Communicator at Eccentex Corporation

How to go from a conceptual prompt to a functional, real-life agent without getting lost in a sea of code and complex orchestration frameworks?
I'll walk through a practical, real-world scenario: building an AI agent that automates tasks. I'll show how to leverage Langflow's visual interface to connect different components—from an LLM's reasoning engine to external API tools and data sources—to create an intelligent workflow.
In this talk, I'll provide a clear, actionable blueprint. Topics to cover:

* The core components of an AI agent and how they function.
* How to use Langflow to rapidly prototype and deploy agents.
* Integrating external tools and APIs.
* A practical example from a real-life scenario.

### [Christi Kapp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/artinmotionllc/)

Our GDG founder Christi Kapp will be leading a bold new track, The Company Pitch track at DevFest Florida. This track is focused on the hypothetical company “Event Horizon Labs”, which is tasked with becoming the trigger for the technological "Singularity" where AI surpasses human intelligence. Product Manager teams are challenged to create a business plan and product definition for this company, detailing the mechanism of the trigger itself and how it will scale globally. A core component of the pitch must also include human-centric guardrails to ensure the preservation and expansion of human dignity, creativity, and agency in a post-Singularity world. Teams must also define a business model, identify early adopters, and craft a narrative and brand that inspires trust and momentum for this transformative vision. Judging is based on visionary impact, responsibility, feasibility, and creativity, culminating in a plan for a new era of civilization.

**About Christi Kapp**: I have played numerous roles throughout my career including Executive Leadership, Technology Leader, Business Management Consultant and more. I thrive in environments that value contributions of people that have a unique ability to "connect the dots between disparate aspects of an organization" to enable desired business outcomes. I creates and connects combinations of people, processes and technology.
