AI Product Manager | Specializing in Delivering Production-Ready AI Solutions at Disney

This talk will explore the critical and often misunderstood role of the technical product manager in bridging the gap between research & development and real-world application. We will follow a model's lifecycle, from the initial stages of defining research goals, through the challenges of deployment, and into the long-term work of sustainment. Learn how effective technical product management ensures that groundbreaking research delivers tangible, valuable, and sustainable products.

### <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/delgueta">David M. Elgueta</a> | AI Agents, MCP, Langflow examples
Senior Technical Communicator at Eccentex Corporation

How to go from a conceptual prompt to a functional, real-life agent without getting lost in a sea of code and complex orchestration frameworks?
I'll walk through a practical, real-world scenario: building an AI agent that automates tasks. I'll show how to leverage Langflow's visual interface to connect different components—from an LLM's reasoning engine to external API tools and data sources—to create an intelligent workflow.
In this talk, I'll provide a clear, actionable blueprint. Topics to cover:

* The core components of an AI agent and how they function.
* How to use Langflow to rapidly prototype and deploy agents.
* Integrating external tools and APIs.
* A practical example from a real-life scenario.
