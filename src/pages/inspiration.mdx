<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p-YTC8jBgQ4?si=sy9BsUfjCFQA65Z9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

By now, we've all heard that the industry is moving towards an "AI first" vision where machine learning powered features like computer vision and natural language processing, drive innovations like autonomous driving, speech & object recognition, smart assistants and more. But what does this mean for developers? Do we need PhD-level expertise in data science? What tools & technologies should we master? Where is it useful and why should we care? In this talk, we'll look at machine learning through a pragmatic lens - learning what you need to get the current job done, then exploring paths you can follow to evolve those solutions as your expertise and requirements grow.

Learn how we could build a richer society – all with just a few self-provided data points.

### AI Is Dangerous, but Not for the Reasons You Think | Sasha Luccioni

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eXdVDhOGqoE?si=DI8zcJUJOb_yz_I8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

AI won't kill us all — but that doesn't make it trustworthy. Instead of getting distracted by future existential risks, AI ethics researcher Sasha Luccioni thinks we need to focus on the technology's current negative impacts, like emitting carbon, infringing copyrights and spreading biased information. She offers practical solutions to regulate our AI-filled future — so it's inclusive and transparent.

### How Arduino is open-sourcing imagination 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UoBUXOOdLXY?si=vkI0fg7H6YGPj4zI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Massimo Banzi helped invent the Arduino, a tiny, easy-to-use open-source microcontroller that's inspired thousands of people around the world to make the coolest things they can imagine -- from toys to satellite gear. Because, as he says, "You don't need anyone's permission to make something great."



### How AI Could Save (Not Destroy) Education

Sal Khan, the founder and CEO of Khan Academy, thinks artificial intelligence could spark the greatest positive transformation education has ever seen. He shares the opportunities he sees for students and educators to collaborate with AI tools -- including the potential of a personal AI tutor for every student and an AI teaching assistant for every teacher -- and demos some exciting new features for their educational chatbot, Khanmigo.

### How can AI create opportunity for our region?

In Florida and Orlando's key industries, AI will largely enhance human roles by automating repetitive tasks, providing deeper insights, and enabling people to focus on higher-value, more creative, and more empathetic work.

Here's how AI is set to enhance human opportunities in each of Orlando's top industries:

### 1. Tourism and Hospitality

* **Personalized Recommendations:** AI can analyze guest data to provide personalized recommendations for dining, attractions, and activities. Human staff can then use these insights to offer a more tailored and memorable experience, moving from being order-takers to experience curators.

### 2. Modeling, Simulation, and Training (MS&T)

* **More Realistic Simulations:** AI enhances the realism and adaptability of simulations by creating dynamic and complex scenarios that respond to a user's decisions. This allows trainees to practice critical skills in high-stakes environments, like aviation or medicine, in a risk-free setting.

* **Adaptive Learning:** AI systems can provide personalized training programs that adjust the difficulty level based on an individual's progress. This allows for a more efficient and effective learning process, with humans acting as coaches and mentors rather than just instructors.

* **Better Feedback and Coaching:** AI provides real-time, objective feedback on a user's performance, which can be invaluable for skill development. Human trainers can then use this data to focus on providing nuanced, qualitative feedback and addressing the "soft skills" that AI cannot.

### 3. Aerospace and Aviation
* **Predictive Maintenance:** AI analyzes data from aircraft sensors to predict potential equipment failures before they occur. This shifts the role of human maintenance crews from reactive repairs to strategic, preventative maintenance, improving safety and reducing downtime.

* **Improved Air Traffic Management:** AI algorithms can optimize flight paths and manage airspace, reducing congestion and human error. Air traffic controllers will transition to roles that involve supervising and overseeing these systems, intervening in complex and unforeseen situations.

* **Data-Driven Decision-Making:** AI provides management with real-time data on everything from fuel consumption to supply chain logistics. This allows human leaders to make more informed, data-driven decisions about everything from route planning to resource allocation.

### 4. Life Sciences and Healthcare
* **Accelerated Research and Drug Discovery:** AI can rapidly screen millions of potential drug candidates and analyze vast datasets to identify new therapeutic targets. This frees up human researchers to focus on the creative, experimental, and analytical aspects of discovery.

* **Automated Administrative Tasks:** AI-powered tools can handle tasks like medical coding, appointment scheduling, and patient history summarization. This reduces the administrative burden on nurses and doctors, allowing them to spend more time on direct patient care.

* **Enhanced Diagnostics:** AI can analyze medical images, such as X-rays and MRIs, to detect subtle anomalies that a human eye might miss. This enhances the diagnostic capabilities of human doctors, who can then use these insights to provide more accurate and timely care.

### 5. Digital Media and Technology
* **Augmented Creativity:** Generative AI tools can automate repetitive aspects of content creation, such as drafting initial code, generating design mockups, or creating marketing copy. This allows human professionals to focus on the higher-level, creative, and strategic aspects of their work.

* **Hyper-Personalized Experiences:** AI-powered recommendation engines and analytics can provide deep insights into user behavior. This enables human developers and designers to create more personalized and engaging user experiences.

* **Intelligent Automation:** AI streamlines workflows and automates tasks, from customer support chatbots to data analysis. This frees up employees to focus on innovative projects, complex problem-solving, and creative collaboration.

### 6. Professional and Business Services
* **Automated Workflows:** AI can automate mundane and repetitive tasks, such as data entry, document review, and report generation. This enables professionals in fields like finance and legal services to focus on strategic analysis, client relationships, and complex problem-solving.

* **Enhanced Data Analysis:** AI systems can analyze massive datasets to identify market trends, customer behavior patterns, and financial risks. This provides human consultants and analysts with deeper insights, enabling them to offer more valuable and strategic advice to their clients.

* **AI Consulting and Implementation:** As more businesses adopt AI, there will be a growing demand for human professionals who can design, implement, and manage these systems. This creates new opportunities for consultants and business strategists with AI expertise.
