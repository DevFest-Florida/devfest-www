### Business Concept:   
Our business is going to be called "Event Horizon Labs".   We are going to become the company that triggers the  "singularity"   Product Manager teams will create a business plan and product definition for this business that includes definition of the mechanisms of the trigger, as well as guardrails for the preservation of human capacity. 

### Singularity is where AI surpasses human intelligence.   
The "singularity" refers to a hypothetical point in time when technological growth becomes so rapid and profound that it becomes difficult or impossible to predict or control the future. This concept is often associated with the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, where AI surpasses human intelligence, leading to potentially unpredictable outcomes. The term also has roots in physics, where it describes a point of infinite density in black holes or the beginning of the universe. 

Your team of Product Managers is tasked with creating a business plan + product definition for Event Horizon Labs. This will include:

### Mechanism of the Trigger
- What is the specific breakthrough (technology, platform, or network) that pushes humanity past the Singularity threshold?
- How does it scale globally?
- What is the architecture (technical + organizational) that enables inevitability?

### Human-Centric Guardrails
- How do we ensure the preservation‚Äîand expansion‚Äîof human dignity, creativity, and agency in a post-Singularity world?
- What ethical, economic, and cultural safeguards must be built in from the start?

### Business Model & Ecosystem
