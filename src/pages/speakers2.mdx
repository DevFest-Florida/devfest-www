### Keynote

“Breaking through” and finding that first job as an entry-level developer was already hard, and it’s only getting worse: Layoffs saturated the early-career talent pool, the skill floor keeps ramping up, job postings have fallen off, the specter of AI looms, and economic uncertainty has been lopped on top. It feels like a lot of people are holding their breath and waiting for something to shake out.

Organizations need junior developers and the senior-level skills they represent in the future. Current senior-level developers need them, too. The fix? It’s a combination of coursework, community, employers, and the developers themselves. We’ll talk through each, and why we can’t leave the current situation as-is.

Vonage

#### Hackathon Challenge
“The Challenge: Building Community Through Live Streaming.” Teams use the Vonage Video API (and optionally Messaging, Voice, etc.) to create an interactive live-streaming experience that goes beyond broadcasting — think Q&A, co-streaming panels, watch parties, captions, breakout rooms, etc. Goal: design an engaging solution that shows how live streaming can foster real community.

Dwane will be leading guests through an interactive code-along where participants:
- Get guided through Vonage’s APIs, sandbox, and dashboard
- Learn what Web Components are and who uses them
- Create a Web Component
- Use that Web Component in a framework of their choice
- Build a live streaming platform with the Vonage Video API

Team Vonage will be providing a Slack channel for participants to ask Vonage team for help.

### <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/delgueta">David M. Elgueta</a> | AI Agents, MCP, Langflow examples
Senior Technical Communicator at Eccentex Corporation

How to go from a conceptual prompt to a functional, real-life agent without getting lost in a sea of code and complex orchestration frameworks?
I'll walk through a practical, real-world scenario: building an AI agent that automates tasks. I'll show how to leverage Langflow's visual interface to connect different components—from an LLM's reasoning engine to external API tools and data sources—to create an intelligent workflow.
In this talk, I'll provide a clear, actionable blueprint. Topics to cover:

* The core components of an AI agent and how they function.
* How to use Langflow to rapidly prototype and deploy agents.
* Integrating external tools and APIs.
* A practical example from a real-life scenario.

### [Christi Kapp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/artinmotionllc/)

Our GDG founder Christi Kapp will be leading a bold new track, The Company Pitch track at DevFest Florida. This track is focused on the hypothetical company “Event Horizon Labs”, which is tasked with becoming the trigger for the technological "Singularity" where AI surpasses human intelligence. Product Manager teams are challenged to create a business plan and product definition for this company, detailing the mechanism of the trigger itself and how it will scale globally. A core component of the pitch must also include human-centric guardrails to ensure the preservation and expansion of human dignity, creativity, and agency in a post-Singularity world. Teams must also define a business model, identify early adopters, and craft a narrative and brand that inspires trust and momentum for this transformative vision. Judging is based on visionary impact, responsibility, feasibility, and creativity, culminating in a plan for a new era of civilization.

**About Christi Kapp**: I have played numerous roles throughout my career including Executive Leadership, Technology Leader, Business Management Consultant and more. I thrive in environments that value contributions of people that have a unique ability to "connect the dots between disparate aspects of an organization" to enable desired business outcomes. I creates and connects combinations of people, processes and technology.

### [Leo Farias](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leofarias)	

Gen UI, Epheneral UI | CEO of [Concepta](https://www.conceptatech.com/) 		

The static interface era is ending. This session explores ""Fleeting Interfaces"" - ephemeral UIs that intelligently evolve without explicit programming. Unlike traditional adaptive designs, these interfaces transform based on usage patterns and context, with elements appearing, adapting, and vanishing as needed. Through schema-driven architecture in Flutter, powered by Gemini for decision-making, I'll demonstrate how interfaces become living temporal experiences. Discover how combining Flutter's rendering capabilities with AI can create interfaces that respond to the fourth dimension - time - establishing a new paradigm for truly responsive digital experiences.

## Session Details
See the future of UI with Flutter and Gemini AI:

* Build with behaviors, not states: Schema systems that adapt naturally
* Smart interfaces: AI-powered decisions based on how users interact
* Live demos of tomorrow's UIs:
* Interfaces that shift with context and learn from use
* Elements that appear when needed and vanish when done
* Demos showing real world applications

Leo Farias is a Flutter and Dart GDE with extensive experience in interactive design, dynamic user interfaces. Currently leading Bitwild, an Innovations lab at Concepta Technologies, Leo Farias specializes in creating next-generation UX that push the boundaries of what's possible with Flutter. With a focus on generative UI and open source contributions, Leo Farias has developed Mix, an open-source styling system for Flutter, and created headless component libraries and design systems for the Flutter ecosystem. This work in schema-driven interfaces directly informs the ephemeral UI concepts presented in this talk.
