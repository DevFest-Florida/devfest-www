“Breaking through” and finding that first job as an entry-level developer was already hard, and it’s only getting worse: Layoffs saturated the early-career talent pool, the skill floor keeps ramping up, job postings have fallen off, the specter of AI looms, and economic uncertainty has been lopped on top. It feels like a lot of people are holding their breath and waiting for something to shake out.

Organizations need junior developers and the senior-level skills they represent in the future. Current senior-level developers need them, too. The fix? It’s a combination of coursework, community, employers, and the developers themselves. We’ll talk through each, and why we can’t leave the current situation as-is.
